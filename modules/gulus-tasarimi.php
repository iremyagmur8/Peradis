A positive change in your smile takes your self-confidence to the next level. Today, within the framework of the possibilities offered by social media, which has gained a great place in our lives, visuality has come to the fore, and the awareness of a beautiful smile has been established along with concepts such as beauty and aesthetics. Dentistry was known for a long time with the treatment of decayed teeth and relief of pain in the mouth. Aesthetic procedures were not considered much due to lower expectations, insufficient material quality and expensiveness. However, over time, with the development of dental materials along with technology, concepts such as beauty and aesthetics, personalized smile design became one of the main areas of interest of dentistry. Today, it is not enough to have a mouth free from biological and functional problems for dental patients. They want to have beautiful smiles that are integrated with their physical features but more compatible with their emotional aspects, and therefore dentistry has developed further to meet the demands and aesthetic expectations of today`s patients, thanks to the use of DSD. Digital smile design is a multi-use conceptual tool that can strengthen diagnostic vision, improve communication and increase predictability throughout treatment. To keep up with the needs of the modern age, dentists need to go beyond the boundaries of traditional dentistry and acquire a range of artistic skills and visions to become `Smile Designers`. In short, smile design is a treatment in which a personalized smile is planned and presented to the patient in a short time by blending medical knowledge with aesthetics and art. Everyone has the right to smile sincerely and beautifully in today`s world where possibilities are so developed.','gulus-tasarimi') ?>

Photo and video recordings of our patient who applied to our clinic are performed in the first session. Complaints and expectations are noted. After all this data is collected, the images are transferred to a computer, followed by image calibration using a digital ruler, and then the images are edited. On the radiographs, the health status of the teeth, gingiva and bone is examined. Then, the gingival levels, which teeth the design and treatment processes need to be covered, the relationship between the smile line and the lip are evaluated on the photographs, and the treatment plan is clarified. Smile redesign is performed using presentation software. After a final digital smile design has been customized using smile design principles and fulfilling the patient`s wishes, digital images can be shared with dental technicians, internet-using specialists in the form of PDF, keynote or power point files, and a treatment plan can also be presented. The redesigned smile is presented to the patient. After digital confirmation by the patient, the design created using the same calculated analyzes can be transferred to the patient`s mouth and aesthetically tested by means of a mock-up (temporary teeth) created by the dental technician. The patient`s opinion is taken about the smile, which is a copy of the newly created smile, which is checked with the patient in the mouth, and the design takes its final shape with minor retouching if necessary. This will enable the patient to experience a new aesthetic, functional and emotional new smile, have foresight about the new smile he will gain at the end of the treatment, and accelerate the decision-making phase. The information of the new design, which has been tested and approved by the patient and the physician, is transferred to the laboratory again.
